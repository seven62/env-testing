      The basic idea is to practice accidentally deleting one of our local
      branches (which I've done a few times), and then finding it again in the
      reflog. Scary, right! I used to think so, but don't worry...the reflog can
      help us.

      Rebasing is scary for people. We need to practice it to feel less scared.
      Practicing with immediate actionable feedback could help this process.
